# ðŸŽ¯ Mini Python Series â€“ Py1 

Welcome to **Py1**, a mini Python project series created during my summer break! This series is designed to strengthen my Python fundamentals by working on small, fun projects that involve **user input**, **conditional logic**, and **loops**.

## This Py1 series include:
1. Random Number Guess
2. Simple Quiz Game
3. Basic Calculator
4. Age Category Checker

## Technology Used: Python 3.x
