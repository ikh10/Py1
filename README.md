This is the first project in my Mini Python Series during my summer break. This project focuses on practicing Python basics, including loops, conditionals, and user input.

The Random Number Guess game is a simple Python script where the user has to guess a randomly generated number within a specific range.

**Features:**

1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.

2. The player has to guess the number.

3. The game gives hints whether the guess is too high or too low.

4. The game continues until the user guesses the correct number.


**Technologies Used:** Python 3.x
